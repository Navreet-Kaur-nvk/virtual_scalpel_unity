# Virtual Scalpel

This repository contains my fork of the Virtual Scalpel project focused on 3D surgical simulation for gallbladder surgery.

## My Contributions
- Created detailed 3D anatomical models of the gallbladder and surrounding tissues.
- Organized and optimized 3D assets for integration with the simulation.
- Added textures and layered models to enhance realism.

## Tools Used
- Blender for modeling and texturing
- Unity for simulation integration (collaboration)
